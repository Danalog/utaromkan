uromkan
-----------

uromkan is a module that provides a number of routines to do romaji <-> kana
conversion and normalization, both to kunrei and hepburn romanizations.  It
does this using the utf-8 encoding of unicode.

It was originally written by Satoru Takabayashi <satoru-t@is.aist-nara.ac.jp>
as a Perl library, and ported to Python by Eric Nichols <eric-n@is.naist.jp>
for use with EUC-jp.  This port is known as ``romkan``.
